## Portfolio
This portfolio is build with **JavaScript** front end with **Express** backend. The backend is only used for connecting with the server for `GET` requests with my navigation bar and some of json data that is passed with **EJS** syntax.

## Setting up
`cd` into the project directory 
  
## start the server

**Since** I have nodemon set up, once you `npm install`
you can start server with `npm start`
